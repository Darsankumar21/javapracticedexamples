How Programmer Handle an Exception?


Customized Exception Handling: Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally. 
Briefly, here is how they work. Program statements that you think can raise exceptions are contained within a try block.
 If an exception occurs within time try block, it is thrown.
Your code can catch this exception (using catch block) and handle it in some rational manner. 
System-generated exceptions are automatically thrown by the Java run- time system. 
To manually throw an exception, use the keyword thread. Any exception that is thrown out of a method 
must be specified as such by a throws clause. Any code that absolutely must be executed after a try block completes 
is put in a finally block.
